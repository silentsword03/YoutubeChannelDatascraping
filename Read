The Data I have is not in real time. I have taken into account the data from the website https://www.speakrj.com/. However, if you need access to real-time data for digital marketing purposes, I suggest using Social Blade. It provides up-to-date information that can be beneficial for your digital marketing efforts.
The data I have considered is specifically for the channels in the Entertainment category. If you are interested in data for other categories, the same process can be repeated. The website you mentioned, https://www.speakrj.com/, offers information across approximately 67 categories. By exploring each category, you can gather valuable insights for your digital marketing strategies.
